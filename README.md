# Coffeescript Algorithms and Data Structures, TDD'd

## Mission

This is a personal project to crystallize my knowledge of algorithms and data structures.  I'm using coffeescript because I love it (and because I haven't seen many coffee implementations out there).

The goals here are code that reads like English--no single-letter variable names, blegch--and good test coverage.

## Instructions

To run specs:

1. Install jasmine for node: `npm install jasmine-node -g`
2. Run `jasmine-node --coffee spec/`
